# Sublime-Vim
A text editor with Vim commands and a GUI inspired by Sublime Text

This is on Open Source project. I love coding with Vim and I am a lot more productive with it. But sometimes, I have to confess that a
beautiful GUI is enjoyable. So, with this project I want to create a beautiful text editor with a modern design while using the Vim commands to be
more productive.
